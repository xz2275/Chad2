General Usage
=============

Chad is an Android App that allows automatic Time Series Analysis of FRED data using your phone.
Enter the "ticker" of the data you want, the analysis will be emailed to you in less than 1 minute.
(The ticker can be found on their website: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/)

At the moment, this App only supports Gmail users.

Installation Instruction
========================

There are two ways to install the .APK file onto your phone, both requre you have an Android phone with internet connection. 
The easiest way is to acroll down this page and download it through the QR code. 
If you'd like to be able to write code on your phone in addition to installing the app, here is the instruction:


- Download SL4A from the website https://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/ by scanning
  the QR code
- Install SL4A and open the App
- From the menu, select "view" and choose "Interpreters"
- From the "Interpreters" window, go to menu and select "Add", choose Python 2.6.2. This 
  will allow you to download the Python Shell.
- Install Python 2.6.2
- Now, move Chad.py file to the scripts folder that other sample Python scripts reside in. 
  For Samsung Galaxy S3, it will be "storage/sdcard/sl4a/scripts". 
- Now you are ready to go. Go to the SL4A app, and find the Chad.py script. Click on it, 
  you can choose running it in the command window open or running it in the background.
- Have fun! 

By the way, you do need a password to use this App. This is a "place holder" for something 
that can be developed into a user registration system. The current password is "carol".

One caveat of using the App is that you need to email Long Zheng to ask him to have his Outlook open...
