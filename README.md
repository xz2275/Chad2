Version 0.0 04/23/2013

'Chad' is a project Carol Zhang and Long Zheng put together for their Financial Computing III class 

General Usage
=============

Chad is an Android App that allows automatic Time Series Analysis of FRED data using your phone.
Enter the "ticker" of the data you want, the analysis will be emailed to you in less than 1 minute.
(The ticker can be found on their website: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/)

At the moment, this App only supports Gmail users.

Installation Instruction
========================

The complete .apk file is not yet available due to a computer specific bug. An alternative 
solution for now is the following:

- Have a mobile device running Android ready
- Download SL4A from the website https://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/ by scanning
  the QR code
- Install SL4A and open the App
- From the menu, select "view" and choose "Interpreters"
- From the "Interpreters" window, go to menu and select "Add", choose Python 2.6.2. This 
  will allow you to download the Python Shell.
- Install Python 2.6.2
- Now, move Chad.py file to the scripts folder that other sample Python scripts reside in. 
  For Samsung Galaxy S3, it will be "storage/sdcard/sl4a/scripts"
- Now you are ready to go. Go to the SL4A app, and find the Chad.py script. Click on it, 
  you can choose running it in the command window open or running it in the background.
- Have fun! 

If you are Prof. Steve Roehrig and wants to test if this actually works, you need to email
Long Zheng to ask him to have his Outlook open...
